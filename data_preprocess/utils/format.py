Because verl use different reward function based on `data_source` value, I alter `verl.utils.reward_score.__init__.default_compute_score, to choose reward function also based on prefix of `data_source` value. 

Below is a collection of prompt templates for different math problem styles. Refer to these datasets (openai/gsm8k, DigitalLearningGmbH/MATH-lighteval, BytedTsinghua-SIA/DAPO-Math-17k) for more details.

	"During your reasoning, you can use python code to perform logic and calculations. And you should always trust the execution result returned by the code executor. After receiving the execution result, you can choose to write more code if needed. Remeber you should prefer reasoning with code to reasoning directly. "

	"The code executor will run your code and return the output (stdout / plain text / error message) back to you between the tags <execution_result> and </execution_result> to support your reasoning process. You will continue your reasoning after receiving the execution result. "
	"Remember that execution result is not formal enough as final answer and you need to follow the output format instructions to provide your final answer. "
